# Personal Notes belonging to Alex Edwards
The purpose of this repository is to facilitate a centralised location for all of Alex's personalised notes. 
The notes will be edited, and managed via Obsidian. i.e. A markdown editor and notes organisor that is compatiable with both linux and windows.

This is in the hopes to make Alex more organised, and find information more easily. Through the use of inter-linked files.
